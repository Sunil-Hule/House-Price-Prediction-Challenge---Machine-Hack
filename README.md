# House-Price-Prediction-Challenge---Machine-Hack
Welcome to the House Price Prediction Challenge, you will test your regression skills by designing an algorithm to accurately predict the house prices in India. Accurately predicting house prices can be a daunting task. The buyers are just not concerned about the size(square feet) of the house and there are various other factors that play a key role to decide the price of a house/property. It can be extremely difficult to figure out the right set of attributes that are contributing to understanding the buyer's behavior as such.
